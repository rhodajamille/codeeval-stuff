codeeval-stuff
==============

just for kicks and giggles...

Nothing exciting here, just some code I submitted for code eval challenges.

If you want to tell me how much faster I can run things or how much memory I'm hogging, that's fine, 
but I ask that you actually have code to back it up if you do - I want to learn too :)
